    "description": "## Plan Reference\nSection 10.7 (Conformance + Verification).\nCross-cutting dependencies: Phase A exit gate (baseline conformance passes), Phase B exit gate (probabilistic security conformance passes), Phase E exit gate (evidence-backed operational readiness), 10.9 release gates (multiple conformance-gated release blockers).\nMoonshot integrations: 9F.6 (Tri-Runtime Lockstep Oracle), 9F.7 (Autonomous Red-Team Generator), 9I.6 (Verified Self-Replacement), 9I.7 (IFC + Data Confinement Proofs), 9I.8 (Security-Proof-Guided Specialization).\n\n## Purpose\nConvert the plan's conformance and verification intent into an executable, dependency-aware workstream that provides the runtime's correctness, compatibility, and security evidence foundation. Every other section's release gate depends on 10.7 infrastructure for its verification claims. This epic is not a nice-to-have quality layer -- it IS the evidence backbone that makes FrankenEngine's category-defining trust claims machine-verifiable rather than rhetorical.\n\n## Why This Exists\n- Keeps implementation aligned to the ambition-first charter and impossible-by-default capability goals.\n- Prevents drift between strategic language and engineering execution.\n- Ensures every deliverable carries deterministic verification, evidence artifacts, and replay-ready observability.\n- Provides the foundational test infrastructure that all phase exit gates and release gates consume.\n- Makes conformance, compatibility, and security claims continuously verified properties rather than point-in-time assertions.\n\n## Architecture Overview\nThe 10.7 beads form a layered verification pyramid:\n\n**Layer 1 -- Foundational Conformance (Phase A prerequisites):**\n- bd-d93: Transplanted extension conformance assets (harness, waiver file, evidence format -- shared infrastructure for all other beads).\n- bd-11p: test262 ES2020 normative profile (industry-standard correctness oracle, release blocker).\n\n**Layer 2 -- Security Conformance (Phase B prerequisites):**\n- bd-2rk: Probabilistic security conformance (benign/malicious corpora with statistical acceptance criteria).\n- bd-3u0: IFC conformance corpus (dual-capability benign, exfil-attempt, declassification-exception workloads).\n\n**Layer 3 -- Structural Invariant Verification (Phase E prerequisites):**\n- bd-2eu: Metamorphic tests (parser/IR/execution invariants via property-based testing).\n- bd-3c1: Stress tests (high-concurrency workloads validating resource enforcement and stability).\n\n**Layer 4 -- Differential and Equivalence Verification (continuous + release gates):**\n- bd-2vu: Differential lockstep suite (tri-runtime oracle against Node/Bun, 9F.6 implementation).\n- bd-33z: Native-vs-delegate differential gate (per-slot promotion verification, 9I.6 implementation).\n- bd-2pv: Specialization-conformance suite (proof-specialized vs. unspecialized equivalence, 9I.8 implementation).\n\n## Required Quality Bar for All Child Beads\n1. Include concrete implementation detail, not vague intent. Every bead specifies corpus sizes, taxonomy enums, evidence schema fields, and CI gate semantics.\n2. Require focused unit tests for logic/invariant boundaries.\n3. Require end-to-end/integration scenarios with detailed structured logging (trace/policy/decision identifiers where relevant).\n4. Require artifact publication suitable for reproducibility contracts.\n5. Include meta-tests that validate the test infrastructure itself (harness correctness, determinism, evidence schema compliance, gate enforcement).\n6. Produce machine-readable evidence artifacts (`*_evidence.jsonl`) with environment fingerprints, corpus hashes, and run manifests for reproducibility contract compliance.\n\n## Shared Infrastructure Contracts\n- **Waiver file:** `conformance/waivers/conformance_waivers.toml` -- shared by bd-d93 and bd-11p, consumed by CI gates.\n- **Evidence artifact format:** All beads produce `*_evidence.jsonl` with common envelope fields: `run_id`, `timestamp`, `environment_fingerprint`, `corpus_hash`, `run_manifest_hash`.\n- **Structured log schema:** All beads emit logs with common fields: `trace_id`, `component`, `event`, `outcome`, `error_code`, `duration_us`.\n- **CI gate protocol:** Each bead defines explicit pass/fail criteria. No bead uses \"expected failure\" suppression outside the waiver file. All gates are wired into the appropriate phase exit gate checklist.\n\n## Execution Order (Dependency-Driven)\n1. bd-d93 (transplanted assets) -- foundational, no 10.7 internal dependencies.\n2. bd-11p (test262) -- depends on bd-d93 for shared waiver file and evidence format.\n3. bd-2rk (probabilistic security) -- depends on bd-d93 for evidence format, requires 10.5 security subsystems.\n4. bd-2eu (metamorphic tests) -- depends on bd-d93 for evidence format, requires 10.2 parser/IR/evaluator.\n5. bd-3c1 (stress tests) -- depends on 10.5 and 10.11, independent of other 10.7 beads.\n6. bd-2vu (lockstep) -- depends on bd-d93, bd-11p (test262 classification informs divergence triage).\n7. bd-3u0 (IFC conformance) -- depends on 10.2 IFC IR, 10.5 IFC enforcement.\n8. bd-33z (native-vs-delegate) -- depends on 10.2 slot registry, bd-d93 for evidence format.\n9. bd-2pv (specialization conformance) -- depends on 10.15 specialization pipeline, bd-33z for slot testing patterns.\n\n## Success Criteria\n1. All child beads are complete with artifact-backed acceptance evidence (including unit tests, deterministic e2e/integration scripts, structured logging validation, and meta-tests for test infrastructure).\n2. Section-level dependencies remain acyclic and executable in dependency order with no unresolved critical blockers.\n3. Reproducibility/evidence expectations are satisfied (replayability, benchmark/correctness artifacts, and operator verification instructions).\n4. Deliverables preserve full PLAN scope and capability intent with no silent feature/functionality reduction.\n5. Phase A exit gate: test262 normative profile green, transplanted conformance assets green, lockstep corpus green.\n6. Phase B exit gate: probabilistic security conformance passes statistical acceptance criteria, IFC conformance corpus demonstrates deterministic exfiltration blocking.\n7. Phase E exit gate: metamorphic and stress test infrastructure operational and gating releases.\n8. All moonshot verification hooks (9F.6, 9I.6, 9I.7, 9I.8) have corresponding 10.7 beads with active CI gates.\n\n## What\nThis bead tracks and executes the scope encoded in its title and mapped plan references as part of the dependency-constrained program graph. It is a first-class execution/governance item, not an informational placeholder.\n\n## Rationale\nThis bead exists to preserve end-to-end plan fidelity, reduce execution ambiguity, and ensure closure decisions are based on deterministic tests, structured evidence, and dependency-correct readiness rather than informal status reporting.",
    "acceptance_criteria": "1. All child beads for this epic must be completed with artifact-backed evidence and no unresolved critical blockers.\n2. Every child implementation bead must include comprehensive unit tests plus deterministic integration/end-to-end test scripts that validate normal, boundary, failure, and adversarial behavior.\n3. Child test suites must assert structured logging for critical events (`trace_id`, `decision_id`, `policy_id`, `component`, `event`, `outcome`, `error_code`) and include operator-readable diagnostics.\n4. Reproducibility artifacts must be attached or linked for each closed child (`env/manifest`, replay/evidence pointers, verification commands, and benchmark/check outputs where applicable).\n5. Dependency structure must remain acyclic, executable in order, and reflect real implementation sequencing (no false-ready milestones).\n6. Epic closure is allowed only when plan scope is fully preserved (no feature/functionality loss versus referenced PLAN section) and rollback/fallback behavior is documented.\\n7. For any CPU-intensive Rust build/test/benchmark workflow under this epic, require documented or executed `rch` wrappers.",
