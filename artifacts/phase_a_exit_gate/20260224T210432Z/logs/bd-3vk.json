    "description": "## Plan Reference\nSection 10.3: Memory + GC\n\n## Overview\nThis epic covers FrankenEngine's memory management subsystem including allocation domain design, garbage collection with deterministic test mode, and GC pause-time instrumentation with regression budgets.\n\n## Child Beads\n- bd-3w2: Define allocation domains and lifetime classes (foundational)\n- bd-3ub: Implement initial GC with deterministic test mode\n- bd-50o: Add pause-time instrumentation and regression budgets\n\n## Dependency Chain\nbd-3w2 (allocation domains) → bd-3ub (GC implementation) → bd-50o (pause instrumentation)\n\n## Key Requirements\n- Per-extension memory isolation for security\n- Deterministic GC for replay support (9A.3/9F.3)\n- Pause-time budgets for tail-latency control (Phase C)\n- Safe under #![forbid(unsafe_code)] constraint\n\n## Success Criteria\n1. All child beads are complete with artifact-backed acceptance evidence (including unit tests, deterministic e2e/integration scripts, and structured logging validation).\n2. Section-level dependencies remain acyclic and executable in dependency order with no unresolved critical blockers.\n3. Reproducibility/evidence expectations are satisfied (replayability, benchmark/correctness artifacts, and operator verification instructions).\n4. Deliverables preserve full PLAN scope and capability intent with no silent feature/functionality reduction.\n\n## What\nThis bead tracks and executes the scope encoded in its title and mapped plan references as part of the dependency-constrained program graph. It is a first-class execution/governance item, not an informational placeholder.\n\n## Rationale\nThis bead exists to preserve end-to-end plan fidelity, reduce execution ambiguity, and ensure closure decisions are based on deterministic tests, structured evidence, and dependency-correct readiness rather than informal status reporting.",
    "acceptance_criteria": "1. All child beads for this epic must be completed with artifact-backed evidence and no unresolved critical blockers.\n2. Every child implementation bead must include comprehensive unit tests plus deterministic integration/end-to-end test scripts that validate normal, boundary, failure, and adversarial behavior.\n3. Child test suites must assert structured logging for critical events (`trace_id`, `decision_id`, `policy_id`, `component`, `event`, `outcome`, `error_code`) and include operator-readable diagnostics.\n4. Reproducibility artifacts must be attached or linked for each closed child (`env/manifest`, replay/evidence pointers, verification commands, and benchmark/check outputs where applicable).\n5. Dependency structure must remain acyclic, executable in order, and reflect real implementation sequencing (no false-ready milestones).\n6. Epic closure is allowed only when plan scope is fully preserved (no feature/functionality loss versus referenced PLAN section) and rollback/fallback behavior is documented.\\n7. For any CPU-intensive Rust build/test/benchmark workflow under this epic, require documented or executed `rch` wrappers.",
