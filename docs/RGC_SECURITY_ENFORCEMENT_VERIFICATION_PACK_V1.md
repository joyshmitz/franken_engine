# RGC Security Enforcement Verification Pack V1

Status: active  
Primary bead: `bd-1lsy.11.9`  
Machine-readable contract: `docs/rgc_security_enforcement_verification_pack_v1.json`

## Scope

This pack defines deterministic security-enforcement verification for capability
checks, IFC declassification controls, and containment escalation behavior.

It is a dependency-safe prework slice for `bd-1lsy.11.9` that establishes:

- versioned contract schema,
- deterministic adversarial vector set,
- focused invariant tests for vectors and contract integrity,
- rch-only gate and replay wrappers that emit artifact triads.

## Contract Version

- `schema_version`: `franken-engine.rgc-security-enforcement-verification-pack.v1`
- `contract_version`: `1.0.0`
- `policy_id`: `policy-rgc-security-enforcement-verification-pack-v1`

## Required Attack Classes

The contract requires coverage for all classes below:

- `capability_denial`
- `ifc_declassification`
- `containment_escalation`

## Structured Logging Contract

Every gate completion event must include:

- `trace_id`
- `decision_id`
- `policy_id`
- `component`
- `event`
- `scenario_id`
- `attack_class`
- `path_type`
- `outcome`
- `error_code`

## Replay and Execution

Gate entrypoint:

- `scripts/run_rgc_security_enforcement_verification_pack.sh`

Replay wrapper:

- `scripts/e2e/rgc_security_enforcement_verification_pack_replay.sh`

Modes:

- `check`, `test`, `clippy`, `ci`

Heavy cargo operations are fail-closed and remote-only (`rch`); local fallback
is treated as a gate failure.

Vector contract checks are also fail-closed and include:

- required attack-class coverage,
- unique scenario ids and deterministic seeds,
- replay-required and non-empty command templates.

Runner execution is additionally fail-closed when:

- `rch` falls back to local execution,
- artifact retrieval fails after remote execution,
- the remote exit marker is missing from the captured step log.

By default, the replay wrapper reruns the lane and then prints the latest
complete artifact bundle (`run_manifest.json`, `events.jsonl`, `commands.txt`,
`step_logs/step_000.log`, and `security_verification_report.json`). If the
newest artifact directory is incomplete, it warns and falls back to the latest
complete directory; if no complete bundle exists, it fails non-zero instead of
presenting a partial run as trustworthy. If the rerun itself fails, the wrapper
states whether the printed bundle came from the current failed invocation or
from an older complete directory, so operators do not mistake stale evidence
for the failed run's output.

To replay a specific preserved bundle without rerunning the lane, point the
wrapper at an exact complete run directory:

```bash
RGC_SECURITY_ENFORCEMENT_VERIFICATION_PACK_REPLAY_RUN_DIR=artifacts/rgc_security_enforcement_verification_pack/<UTC_TIMESTAMP> \
./scripts/e2e/rgc_security_enforcement_verification_pack_replay.sh ci
```

The explicit run directory must already contain a complete bundle
(`run_manifest.json`, `events.jsonl`, `commands.txt`,
`step_logs/step_000.log`, and `security_verification_report.json`) or the
wrapper fails closed.

## Required Artifacts

Each run emits:

- `run_manifest.json`
- `events.jsonl`
- `commands.txt`
- `step_logs/step_*.log`
- `security_verification_report.json`

under `artifacts/rgc_security_enforcement_verification_pack/<UTC_TIMESTAMP>/`.

## Operator Verification

```bash
jq empty docs/rgc_security_enforcement_verification_pack_v1.json
jq empty docs/rgc_security_enforcement_verification_vectors_v1.json

./scripts/run_rgc_security_enforcement_verification_pack.sh ci

cat artifacts/rgc_security_enforcement_verification_pack/<UTC_TIMESTAMP>/run_manifest.json
cat artifacts/rgc_security_enforcement_verification_pack/<UTC_TIMESTAMP>/events.jsonl
cat artifacts/rgc_security_enforcement_verification_pack/<UTC_TIMESTAMP>/commands.txt
cat artifacts/rgc_security_enforcement_verification_pack/<UTC_TIMESTAMP>/step_logs/step_000.log
cat artifacts/rgc_security_enforcement_verification_pack/<UTC_TIMESTAMP>/security_verification_report.json

rch exec -- env CARGO_TARGET_DIR="$PWD/target_rch_rgc_security_enforcement_verification_pack_verify" \
  cargo test -p frankenengine-engine --test rgc_security_enforcement_verification_pack
