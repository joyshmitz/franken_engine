# RGC React Capability Contract V1

Status: active
Primary bead: bd-1lsy.1.6.1
Track id: RGC-016A
Machine-readable contract: `docs/rgc_react_capability_contract_v1.json`
Matrix extension: `docs/rgc_executable_compatibility_target_matrix_v1.json`

## Purpose

`RGC-016A` extends the RGC compatibility target matrix so React support is
described as explicit capability rows instead of a hand-wavy claim.

Its machine-readable matrix binding is intentionally fail-closed: the React
contract is only considered bound when both required matrix rows remain present,
the integration row `rgc-react-capability-contract` and the replay row
`rgc-react-capability-contract-replay`.

The contract exists to prevent false equivalence between:

- "TS compiles"
- "TSX parses"
- "a demo renders"
- "React is shipped, supported, and parity-gated"

Every React-facing capability must name the owning implementation bead, the
parity gate that must go green before the row can be promoted, and the user or
operator surface that would expose the capability. Unsupported or deferred rows
must fail closed with explicit diagnostics.

## Capability Model

Each row in the machine-readable contract includes:

- `capability_id`
- `source_form`
- `runtime_mode`
- `entry_surface`
- `support_status`
- `owning_implementation_bead`
- `parity_gate_bead`
- `product_surface_bead`
- `verification_lane`
- `required_artifacts`
- `user_visible_diagnostic`
- `unsupported_surface_policy`

Allowed `support_status` values are:

- `unsupported`
- `deferred`
- `gated_preview`
- `shipped`

Until the shipped React operator surface (`bd-1lsy.10.12*`) and the React
parity gates (`bd-1lsy.9.7*`) are green, rows stay in `unsupported` or
`deferred` state and must not be represented as shipped support.

## Explicit Capability Rows

| Capability | Current status | Owning bead | Parity gate | Product surface |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `jsx-classic-runtime-compile` | `deferred` | `bd-1lsy.3.6.1` | `bd-1lsy.9.7.1` | `bd-1lsy.10.12.1` |
| `tsx-classic-runtime-compile` | `deferred` | `bd-1lsy.3.6.1` | `bd-1lsy.9.7.1` | `bd-1lsy.10.12.1` |
| `fragment-lowering-contract` | `deferred` | `bd-1lsy.3.6.1` | `bd-1lsy.9.7.1` | `bd-1lsy.10.12.1` |
| `jsx-automatic-runtime-compile` | `deferred` | `bd-1lsy.3.6.2` | `bd-1lsy.9.7.1` | `bd-1lsy.10.12.1` |
| `tsx-automatic-runtime-compile` | `deferred` | `bd-1lsy.3.6.2` | `bd-1lsy.9.7.1` | `bd-1lsy.10.12.1` |
| `jsx-dev-runtime-diagnostics` | `unsupported` | `bd-1lsy.3.6.2` | `bd-1lsy.9.7.1` | `bd-1lsy.10.12.2` |
| `tsx-dev-runtime-diagnostics` | `unsupported` | `bd-1lsy.3.6.2` | `bd-1lsy.9.7.1` | `bd-1lsy.10.12.2` |
| `react-ssr-entrypoint` | `unsupported` | `bd-1lsy.5.7.2` | `bd-1lsy.9.7.2` | `bd-1lsy.10.12.3` |
| `react-client-entry-preparation` | `unsupported` | `bd-1lsy.5.7.1` | `bd-1lsy.9.7.2` | `bd-1lsy.10.12.3` |
| `react-hydration-handoff-artifacts` | `unsupported` | `bd-1lsy.5.7.2` | `bd-1lsy.9.7.2` | `bd-1lsy.10.12.3` |
| `react-diagnostics-source-maps` | `deferred` | `bd-1lsy.10.5` | `bd-1lsy.9.7.1` | `bd-1lsy.10.12.2` |

`jsx-dev` diagnostics and `tsx-dev` diagnostics remain separate rows on purpose:
the diagnostics surface must be explicit for both source forms so TSX support is
never implied by a JSX-only dev-runtime contract.

## Unsupported-Surface Governance

Rows in `unsupported` or `deferred` state are fail-closed:

- maximum waiver age: `168` hours
- waiver is mandatory before any limited preview or doc-language exception
- user-visible diagnostics are mandatory
- fallback mode must be explicit (`reject_with_guidance` or
  `diagnostic_only_reject`)
- remediation guidance must route through `bd-1lsy.10.11.2`

This contract is intentionally conservative: until a React row has a shipped
product surface plus a green parity gate, the supported user message is "not
yet shipped" rather than "probably works."

## Structured Logging and Artifact Contract

Validation and replay runs must emit structured logs with these required fields:

- `schema_version`
- `scenario_id`
- `trace_id`
- `decision_id`
- `policy_id`
- `component`
- `event`
- `runtime_lane`
- `seed`
- `outcome`
- `error_code`

Artifacts are emitted under:

`artifacts/rgc_react_capability_contract/<UTC_TIMESTAMP>/`

with:

- `run_manifest.json`
- the emitted `policy_id` must stay pinned to
  `policy-rgc-react-capability-contract-v1`, matching the machine-readable
  contract and the gate runner.
- `dirty_worktree` inside `run_manifest.json` must snapshot repository state
  before the current gate writes its own artifacts, and must flip to `true` for
  pre-existing tracked edits or untracked repository files so replay evidence
  never overstates repo cleanliness.
- `trace_ids.json`
- `events.jsonl`
- `commands.txt`
- `react_capability_contract.json`

## Operator Verification

  cargo test -p frankenengine-engine --test rgc_react_capability_contract \
  --test rgc_executable_compatibility_target_matrix

./scripts/run_rgc_react_capability_contract.sh ci

./scripts/e2e/rgc_react_capability_contract_replay.sh ci
