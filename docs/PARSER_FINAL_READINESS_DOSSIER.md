# Parser Final Readiness Dossier (`bd-2mds.1.8.4`)

This document defines the deterministic, machine-checkable final readiness dossier
contract for parser supremacy declaration workflows.

## Contract Version

- `schema_version`: `franken-engine.parser-final-readiness-dossier.v1`
- `dossier_version`: `0.1.0`
- `log_schema_version`: `franken-engine.parser-log-event.v1`

## Required Evidence Linkage

Each dossier must include immutable artifact references for every required gate:

- correctness (`PSRP-08.2`)
- performance (`PSRP-08.3`)
- cross-architecture reproducibility (`PSRP-07.4`)
- operator/developer runbook (`PSRP-10.4`)
- supremacy criteria contract (`PSRP-08.1`)

Every evidence entry must include:

- `evidence_id`
- `status` (`pass|in_progress|fail|missing`)
- `required` (`true|false`)
- `manifest_path`
- `replay_command`

## Risk Register Contract

Residual risks are ranked deterministically and include:

- `risk_id`
- `severity` (`critical|high|medium|low`)
- `likelihood_millionths`
- `impact_millionths`
- `owner`
- `mitigation`
- `trigger_threshold`
- `rollback_trigger_id`
- `status` (`open|mitigated|accepted`)

Open-risk scoring is deterministic and used for hold/fail posture decisions.

## Rollback Posture Contract

Rollback posture must define explicit triggers and deterministic recovery commands.
Each trigger must include:

- `trigger_id`
- `metric`
- `comparison` (`>|>=|<|<=`)
- `threshold_millionths`
- `recovery_command`
- `blast_radius_assumption`

Every open residual risk must reference an existing rollback trigger.

## Independent Verification Contract

Independent verification entries must include:

- `verifier_id`
- `outcome` (`pass|hold|fail`)
- `manifest_path`
- `replay_command`
- `signed_off`

A minimum verifier floor is enforced by gate policy.

## Deterministic Claim Replay Coverage

Each major claim in the dossier must include one-command replay entries:

- `claim_id`
- `replay_command`
- `expected_outcome`

Replay commands must be non-empty and unique.

## Structured Log Contract

Readiness-gate completion logs must include:

- `trace_id`
- `decision_id`
- `policy_id`
- `component`
- `event`
- `outcome`
- `error_code`
- `dossier_id`
- `risk_register_hash`
- `replay_command`

## Deterministic Execution Contract

All heavy Rust checks/tests run through `rch`.

Canonical command:

```bash
./scripts/run_parser_final_readiness_dossier.sh ci
```

Modes:

- `check`: compile focused readiness dossier test target
- `test`: run focused readiness dossier tests
- `clippy`: lint focused readiness dossier target with `-D warnings`
- `ci`: check + test + clippy

## Required Artifacts

Each run must publish:

- `artifacts/parser_final_readiness_dossier/<timestamp>/run_manifest.json`
- `artifacts/parser_final_readiness_dossier/<timestamp>/events.jsonl`
- `artifacts/parser_final_readiness_dossier/<timestamp>/commands.txt`

`run_manifest.json` must include:

- schema/version identifiers
- bead id, dossier version, mode, target-dir, git commit
- deterministic environment fingerprint
- blocked dependency inventory
- deterministic replay command
- command transcript and outcome

## Operator Verification

```bash
./scripts/run_parser_final_readiness_dossier.sh ci
cat artifacts/parser_final_readiness_dossier/<timestamp>/run_manifest.json
cat artifacts/parser_final_readiness_dossier/<timestamp>/events.jsonl
cat artifacts/parser_final_readiness_dossier/<timestamp>/commands.txt
```
