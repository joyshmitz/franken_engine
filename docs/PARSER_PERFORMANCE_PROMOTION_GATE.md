# Parser Performance Promotion Gate (`bd-2mds.1.8.3`)

This contract defines the deterministic parser performance promotion gate for
PSRP-08 readiness.

## Scope

This lane is implemented by:

- `docs/PARSER_PERFORMANCE_PROMOTION_GATE.md`
- `crates/franken-engine/tests/fixtures/parser_performance_promotion_gate_v1.json`
- `crates/franken-engine/tests/parser_performance_promotion_gate.rs`
- `scripts/run_parser_performance_promotion_gate.sh`
- `scripts/e2e/parser_performance_promotion_gate_replay.sh`

## Contract Version

- `schema_version`: `franken-engine.parser-performance-promotion-gate.v1`
- `gate_version`: `1.0.0`

## Promotion Policy

Promotion is fail-closed.

The gate emits:

- `promote`: declared quantile wins versus all required peers are reproducible,
  confidence-bounded, and evidence-complete.
- `hold`: any required quantile win is missing, below threshold,
  confidence-inconclusive, protocol-drifted, or lacks telemetry evidence.

## Benchmark Protocol Requirements

The gate requires benchmark rows with deterministic protocol metadata:

- `workload_id`
- `corpus_id`
- `peer_id`
- `quantile`
- `franken_score_millionths`
- `peer_score_millionths`
- `sample_count`
- `confidence_low_delta_millionths`
- `confidence_high_delta_millionths`
- `protocol_hash`

Required peers and quantiles must be declared in the fixture contract.

## Reproducibility and Confidence Semantics

For every required `(peer_id, quantile)` pair:

1. improvement delta must meet or exceed the declared threshold,
2. confidence interval must be valid (`low <= high`),
3. confidence lower bound must remain strictly positive,
4. sample count must be non-zero,
5. row protocol hash must match the declared gate protocol hash.

A protocol hash mismatch is a hard blocker (`protocol_drift`).
A non-positive confidence lower bound is a hard blocker
(`non_reproducible_win`).

## Evidence Requirements

Mandatory evidence lanes must be `pass`:

- `cross_arch_matrix`
- `correctness_promotion`
- `regression_scoreboard`

Mandatory telemetry artifacts must be present and reproducible:

- `artifact_id`
- `manifest_path`
- `protocol_hash`
- `reproducible`

Any missing lane or non-reproducible telemetry artifact blocks promotion.

## Structured Log Contract

Each gate decision event must include:

- `trace_id`
- `decision_id`
- `policy_id`
- `component`
- `event`
- `outcome`
- `error_code`
- `blocked_pairs`
- `failing_workload_ids`
- `corpus_inventory`
- `quantile_inventory`
- `replay_pointers`

## Deterministic Replay Contract

One-command replay wrapper:

```bash
./scripts/e2e/parser_performance_promotion_gate_replay.sh
```

Exact preserved-bundle replay without rerunning the lane:

```bash
PARSER_PERFORMANCE_PROMOTION_GATE_REPLAY_RUN_DIR=artifacts/parser_performance_promotion_gate/<timestamp> \
  ./scripts/e2e/parser_performance_promotion_gate_replay.sh
```

When `PARSER_PERFORMANCE_PROMOTION_GATE_REPLAY_RUN_DIR` is unset, the replay
wrapper reruns the lane, resolves the latest complete run directory, warns if
the newest artifact directory is incomplete, and then prints the latest
manifest, latest events, latest commands, and latest first step log so
operators can triage without manually hunting through artifact timestamps.

When `PARSER_PERFORMANCE_PROMOTION_GATE_REPLAY_RUN_DIR` is set, replay uses
that exact preserved run directory without rerunning the lane and fails closed
if the explicit run directory is incomplete.

If the just-run gate invocation exits non-zero, replay also reports whether the
printed bundle reflects the current run directory or a latest-complete fallback
directory.

## Deterministic Execution Contract

All heavy Rust checks/tests for this lane run through `rch`.

The gate defaults remote builds into a repo-local, namespaced target directory
(`target_rch_parser_performance_promotion_gate_<mode>_<pid>`) so remote workers
do not depend on fragile `/tmp`-backed incremental state.

Fail-closed `rch` policy:

- fixture preflight is mandatory: missing, unreadable, or structurally invalid
  gate fixtures fail before any heavy `rch` step runs.
- local fallback signatures (`running locally`, `falling back to local`,
  `RCH-E326`, dependency-preflight fallback) are hard failures.
- artifact retrieval failures (`Artifact retrieval failed`, rsync code-23
  retrieval errors) are hard failures.
- missing remote-exit markers are hard failures.
- only remote `exit=0` paired with explicit artifact-timeout signatures is
  treated as recoverable (manifest remains fail-closed on any other ambiguity).
- non-recoverable transport, timeout, or cancellation paths surface directly in
  `failed_command` as `(rch-exit=<code>)`, `(remote-exit=<code>)`, or
  `(timeout-<N>s)` so operators can distinguish them from compiler diagnostics.

Canonical command:

```bash
./scripts/run_parser_performance_promotion_gate.sh ci
```

Pinned operator verify target example:

```bash
CARGO_TARGET_DIR=$PWD/target_rch_parser_performance_promotion_gate_verify \
  ./scripts/run_parser_performance_promotion_gate.sh ci
```

Modes:

- `check`: compile focused performance-gate tests
- `test`: run focused performance-gate tests
- `clippy`: lint focused target with `-D warnings`
- `ci`: check + test + clippy

## Required Artifacts

Each run emits:

- `artifacts/parser_performance_promotion_gate/<timestamp>/run_manifest.json`
- `artifacts/parser_performance_promotion_gate/<timestamp>/events.jsonl`
- `artifacts/parser_performance_promotion_gate/<timestamp>/commands.txt`
- `artifacts/parser_performance_promotion_gate/<timestamp>/step_logs/step_*.log`

If the gate fails before any remote step starts, the manifest still emits a
fail-closed operator verification command that explains no step logs were
captured, rather than pointing at a nonexistent `step_000.log`.

Manifest includes gate mode, deterministic replay command, benchmark protocol
hash, blocked pair inventory, deterministic environment fingerprint fields,
and pass/fail outcome.

## Operator Verification

```bash
CARGO_TARGET_DIR=$PWD/target_rch_parser_performance_promotion_gate_verify \
  ./scripts/run_parser_performance_promotion_gate.sh ci
cat artifacts/parser_performance_promotion_gate/<timestamp>/run_manifest.json
cat artifacts/parser_performance_promotion_gate/<timestamp>/events.jsonl
cat artifacts/parser_performance_promotion_gate/<timestamp>/commands.txt
cat artifacts/parser_performance_promotion_gate/<timestamp>/step_logs/step_000.log
./scripts/e2e/parser_performance_promotion_gate_replay.sh
PARSER_PERFORMANCE_PROMOTION_GATE_REPLAY_RUN_DIR=artifacts/parser_performance_promotion_gate/<timestamp> \
  ./scripts/e2e/parser_performance_promotion_gate_replay.sh
```

Replay wrapper fail-closed behavior:

- if no complete artifact bundle exists, replay exits non-zero even if the just-run
  command path returned zero.
- if `PARSER_PERFORMANCE_PROMOTION_GATE_REPLAY_RUN_DIR` points at an incomplete
  preserved bundle, replay exits non-zero immediately.
- if the newest artifact directory is incomplete, replay warns and falls back to
  the latest complete run directory.
- if the just-run gate invocation failed, replay states whether the surfaced
  bundle came from the current run directory or a latest-complete fallback.
- replay surfaces the latest complete bundle by printing the latest manifest,
  latest events, latest commands, and latest first step log.
