# RGC CLI and Operator Workflow Verification Pack V1

Status: active  
Primary bead: `bd-1lsy.11.11`  
Machine-readable contract: `docs/rgc_cli_operator_workflow_verification_pack_v1.json`

## Scope

This contract defines deterministic CLI and operator workflow verification for
RGC onboarding and diagnostics flows, with explicit golden-path and failure-path
coverage.

The pack is evidence-first:

- validates workflow readiness and actionable diagnostics output,
- verifies machine-readable scorecard structure and artifact completeness,
- enforces failure-path clarity for common operator misconfigurations,
- emits replay-stable run-manifest/event/command artifacts.

## Contract Version

- `schema_version`: `franken-engine.rgc-cli-operator-workflow-verification-pack.v1`
- `contract_version`: `1.0.0`
- `policy_id`: `policy-rgc-cli-operator-workflow-verification-pack-v1`

## Workflow Stages

The operator workflow stage set is fixed and versioned:

- `init`
- `compile`
- `run`
- `verify`
- `benchmark`
- `replay`
- `triage`

Stage coverage in this pack focuses on runtime diagnostics onboarding and
operator triage quality:

- `run` + `verify`: `runtime_diagnostics onboarding-scorecard ...`
- `triage`: summary + reproducible command guidance from scorecard output
- failure-path triage: deterministic missing-input and invalid-signals diagnostics

## Golden-Path and Failure-Path Matrix

Golden path:

- clean input emits `readiness=ready`
- summary includes reproducible commands
- output bundle writes both preflight report and onboarding scorecard artifacts

Failure paths:

- missing input file fails with deterministic actionable error text
- invalid signals JSON fails with deterministic parse diagnostics
- blocked scorecard path produces actionable next steps and replay command links

## Structured Logging Contract

Every gate completion event must include:

- `trace_id`
- `decision_id`
- `policy_id`
- `component`
- `event`
- `scenario_id`
- `path_type`
- `outcome`
- `error_code`

## Replay and Execution

Gate entrypoint:

- `scripts/run_rgc_cli_operator_workflow_verification_pack.sh`

Replay wrapper:

- `scripts/e2e/rgc_cli_operator_workflow_verification_pack_replay.sh`

Modes:

- `check`, `test`, `clippy`, `ci`

Strict mode is fail-closed and requires remote execution for heavy cargo
operations (`rch` only, no local fallback).

## Required Artifacts

Each run emits:

- `run_manifest.json`
- `events.jsonl`
- `commands.txt`
- `support_bundle/preflight_report.json` (from verified CLI workflow)
- `support_bundle/onboarding_scorecard.json` (from verified CLI workflow)

under `artifacts/rgc_cli_operator_workflow_verification_pack/<UTC_TIMESTAMP>/`.

## Operator Verification

```bash
jq empty docs/rgc_cli_operator_workflow_verification_pack_v1.json

rch exec -- env CARGO_TARGET_DIR=/tmp/rch_target_rgc_cli_operator_workflow_verification_pack \
  cargo test -p frankenengine-engine --test rgc_cli_operator_workflow_verification_pack

./scripts/run_rgc_cli_operator_workflow_verification_pack.sh ci
./scripts/e2e/rgc_cli_operator_workflow_verification_pack_replay.sh ci
```
