# Control-Plane Benchmark Split Gate (`bd-1rdj`)

Deterministic benchmark gate for Section 10.13 item 17.

This gate enforces that control-plane integrations remain bounded while VM hot-loop
performance stays decoupled from control-plane overhead.

The verification bundle now emits the bead-specific reports required by
`bd-3nr.1.5.2`:

- `control_plane_real_context_overhead_report.json`
- `benchmark_split_delta_report.json`

The first report attributes cost to corrected-path components instead of a single
aggregate number. It separates:

- user-visible path overhead (`baseline` -> `evidence_emission`)
- operator-visible gate/runtime overhead (`evidence_emission` -> `full_integration`)

The delta report publishes deterministic split-by-split comparisons for:

- previous stage deltas
- shortcut-baseline deltas
- previous snapshot deltas

## Split Model

Required benchmark splits:

- `baseline`: VM hot-loop with control-plane adapter stubbed out.
- `cx_threading`: baseline + Cx propagation.
- `decision_contracts`: Cx + decision contract checks on high-impact actions.
- `evidence_emission`: Cx + decision contracts + evidence emission.
- `full_integration`: all control-plane features enabled.

## Reported Metrics

Each split records:

- throughput (`throughput_ops_per_sec`)
- latency (`p50_ns`, `p95_ns`, `p99_ns`)
- memory overhead (`peak_rss_delta_bytes`, delta from baseline)

## Default Thresholds

| Check | Limit |
| --- | ---: |
| Baseline stability CV | `< 5%` (50,000 ppm) across at least 10 runs |
| Cx throughput regression vs baseline | `< 1%` (10,000 ppm) |
| Decision latency regression vs Cx (p95/p99) | `< 5%` (50,000 ppm) |
| Evidence throughput regression vs decision | `< 2%` (20,000 ppm) |
| Full integration throughput regression vs baseline | `< 5%` (50,000 ppm) |

Failing any threshold sets `rollback_required=true`.

## Regression Detection

The evaluator compares candidate split metrics to a previous benchmark snapshot and
fails on threshold breaches using structured failure codes.

Core failure codes:

- `missing_split_metrics`
- `insufficient_baseline_runs`
- `baseline_variance_exceeded`
- `invalid_metric`
- `throughput_regression_exceeded`
- `latency_regression_exceeded`
- `memory_overhead_exceeded`
- `previous_run_regression_exceeded`

## Structured Logs

Decision output emits stable log fields:

- `trace_id`
- `decision_id`
- `policy_id`
- `component`
- `event`
- `outcome`
- `error_code`

Events include:

- `baseline_stability_check`
- `split_evaluation`
- `benchmark_split_decision`

## Test Coverage

Implemented tests include:

- baseline stability gate: 10-run CV checks and insufficient-run rejection
- adapter sleep regression detection: induced latency/throughput regression triggers rollback
- split isolation: disabling evidence emission restores decision-level throughput
- workflow assertion: CI workflow must run the benchmark split gate suite

## RCH Runner

All heavy Rust commands are offloaded through `rch` in the suite runner:

```bash
./scripts/run_control_plane_benchmark_split_gate_suite.sh bundle
./scripts/run_control_plane_benchmark_split_gate_suite.sh ci
./scripts/e2e/control_plane_benchmark_split_gate_replay.sh test
```

The runner is fail-closed for heavy commands:

- `rch` is required; there is no local fallback path for Cargo-heavy verification.
- default remote target dirs are repo-local and namespaced, for example:

```bash
env CARGO_TARGET_DIR="$PWD/target_rch_control_plane_benchmark_split_gate_verify" \
  ./scripts/run_control_plane_benchmark_split_gate_suite.sh test
```

Supported modes:

- `bundle`
- `check`
- `test`
- `clippy`
- `ci`

## Reproducibility Artifacts

Each run writes:

- `artifacts/control_plane_benchmark_split_gate/<timestamp>/commands.txt`
- `artifacts/control_plane_benchmark_split_gate/<timestamp>/control_plane_real_context_overhead_report.json`
- `artifacts/control_plane_benchmark_split_gate/<timestamp>/benchmark_split_delta_report.json`
- `artifacts/control_plane_benchmark_split_gate/<timestamp>/events.jsonl`
- `artifacts/control_plane_benchmark_split_gate/<timestamp>/run_manifest.json`
- `artifacts/control_plane_benchmark_split_gate/<timestamp>/step_logs/step_*.log`
- `artifacts/control_plane_benchmark_split_gate/<timestamp>/env.json`
- `artifacts/control_plane_benchmark_split_gate/<timestamp>/summary.md`
- `artifacts/control_plane_benchmark_split_gate/<timestamp>/repro.lock`
- `artifacts/control_plane_benchmark_split_gate/<timestamp>/trace_ids`

`run_manifest.json` includes operator verification commands and artifact pointers.
`events.jsonl` includes stable `scenario_id` and `seed` fields for replay and
triage.
The replay wrapper prefers the suite entrypoint directly:

```bash
./scripts/e2e/control_plane_benchmark_split_gate_replay.sh test
cat artifacts/control_plane_benchmark_split_gate/<timestamp>/step_logs/step_000.log
```

When rerunning against preserved artifacts, the replay wrapper now resolves the
latest complete bundle automatically, warns when the newest directory is
incomplete, and prints the manifest, trace ids, events, commands, summary,
environment lockfiles, both benchmark reports, and the first retained step log.

To inspect an exact preserved run directory without rerunning the suite, set:

```bash
CONTROL_PLANE_BENCHMARK_SPLIT_GATE_REPLAY_RUN_DIR=artifacts/control_plane_benchmark_split_gate/<timestamp> \
  ./scripts/e2e/control_plane_benchmark_split_gate_replay.sh test
```

The explicit run directory must already contain:

- `run_manifest.json`
- `events.jsonl`
- `commands.txt`
- `control_plane_real_context_overhead_report.json`
- `benchmark_split_delta_report.json`
- `summary.md`
- `env.json`
- `repro.lock`
- `trace_ids`
- `step_logs/step_000.log`
