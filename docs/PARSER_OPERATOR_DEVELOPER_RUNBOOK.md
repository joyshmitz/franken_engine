# Parser Operator/Developer Runbook (`bd-2mds.1.10.4`)

This runbook provides replay-first troubleshooting workflows for parser lanes so
fresh operators and developers can diagnose failures without insider context.

## Scope

This runbook is the operational contract for `PSRP-10.4` and ties together:

- deterministic parser environment controls (`docs/PARSER_FRONTIER_ENV_CONTRACT.md`)
- diagnostics quality checks (`docs/PARSER_DIAGNOSTICS_QUALITY_RUBRIC.md`)
- recovery/resync adversarial drills (`docs/PARSER_ERROR_RECOVERY_RESYNC_ADVERSARIAL_E2E.md`)
- API compatibility checks (`docs/PARSER_API_COMPATIBILITY_CONTRACT.md`)
- user-impact guardrails (`docs/PARSER_USER_IMPACT_REGRESSION_ALARMS_SLO_GUARDRAILS.md`)

Implementation surfaces:

- `scripts/run_parser_operator_developer_runbook.sh`
- `scripts/e2e/parser_operator_developer_runbook_replay.sh`
- `crates/franken-engine/tests/parser_operator_developer_runbook.rs`
- `crates/franken-engine/tests/fixtures/parser_operator_developer_runbook_v1.json`

## Deterministic Environment And Log Contract

All runbook drills must source `scripts/e2e/parser_deterministic_env.sh` and
publish parser-log-schema-compatible events with stable keys:

- `trace_id`
- `decision_id`
- `policy_id`
- `component`
- `event`
- `outcome`
- `error_code`

Required policy ID:

- `policy-parser-operator-developer-runbook-v1`

All heavy Rust checks and tests for this lane run through `rch`.

The runbook wrapper defaults remote builds into a repo-local namespaced target
directory (`target_rch_parser_operator_developer_runbook_<mode>_<pid>`) so
fresh-operator drills do not depend on fragile `/tmp` worker state.

Compile-only preflight for `check` and the first `ci` step uses
`cargo test --no-run -p frankenengine-engine --test parser_operator_developer_runbook`
instead of `cargo check`. This preserves the integration-test compile smoke path
under `rch` and avoids the false-negative timeout/early-exit behavior that can
make `cargo check` look like an infrastructure failure instead of a real build
result.

## Fresh-Operator Dry Run

Run from repository root:

```bash
./scripts/run_parser_operator_developer_runbook.sh ci
```

Expected artifacts:

- `artifacts/parser_operator_developer_runbook/<timestamp>/run_manifest.json`
- `artifacts/parser_operator_developer_runbook/<timestamp>/events.jsonl`
- `artifacts/parser_operator_developer_runbook/<timestamp>/commands.txt`
- `artifacts/parser_operator_developer_runbook/<timestamp>/step_logs/step_*.log`

## Replay-First Troubleshooting Decision Tree

1. **Symptom: diagnostics drift / unstable parser error quality**
   - Primary drill:
     - `./scripts/run_parser_diagnostics_quality_rubric.sh ci`
2. **Symptom: malformed-input recovery or resync regressions**
   - Primary drill:
     - `./scripts/e2e/parser_error_recovery_adversarial_replay.sh`
3. **Symptom: parser API or integration compatibility regressions**
   - Primary drill:
     - `./scripts/run_parser_api_compatibility_gate.sh ci`
4. **Symptom: user-impact SLO alarm or rollout quality hold**
   - Primary drill:
     - `./scripts/e2e/parser_user_impact_regression_alarms_replay.sh`
5. **Symptom: failover/fallback ambiguity under pressure**
   - Primary drill:
     - `./scripts/run_parser_failover_controls_gate.sh ci`
6. **Symptom: `rch` artifact retrieval failure / transfer corruption**
   - Primary drill:
     - `./scripts/run_parser_operator_developer_runbook.sh check`
   - Fail-closed signatures (treat as gate failure, not soft pass):
     - `Artifact retrieval failed`
     - `Failed to retrieve artifacts:`
     - `rsync artifact retrieval failed`
     - `rsync error: ... code 23`
   - Remediation:
     - inspect worker health with `rch status --jobs --workers`
     - rerun only after remote artifact transport is healthy

## Scriptable Drill Lane

Runbook drill mode (test contract + replay-path check):

```bash
./scripts/run_parser_operator_developer_runbook.sh drill
```

One-command replay wrapper:

```bash
./scripts/e2e/parser_operator_developer_runbook_replay.sh drill
```

In `drill` mode, the local replay helper commands also write their stdout/stderr
into later step logs (`step_logs/step_001.log`, `step_logs/step_002.log`, ...)
so operators can inspect the exact replay-helper output without rerunning the
same shell drills.

By default, the replay wrapper reruns the selected lane and then prints the latest complete
artifact bundle (`run_manifest.json`, `events.jsonl`, `commands.txt`, and
`step_logs/step_000.log`). If the newest artifact directory is incomplete, it
warns and falls back to the latest complete directory; if no complete bundle
exists, it fails non-zero instead of presenting a partial run as trustworthy.
If the rerun itself fails, the wrapper explicitly states whether the printed
bundle came from the current failed invocation or from an older complete
directory, so operators do not mistake stale evidence for the failed run's
output.

To replay a specific preserved bundle without rerunning the lane, point the
wrapper at an exact complete run directory:

```bash
PARSER_OPERATOR_DEVELOPER_RUNBOOK_REPLAY_RUN_DIR=artifacts/parser_operator_developer_runbook/<timestamp> \
./scripts/e2e/parser_operator_developer_runbook_replay.sh ci
```

The explicit run directory must already contain a complete bundle
(`run_manifest.json`, `events.jsonl`, `commands.txt`, and
`step_logs/step_000.log`) or the wrapper fails closed.

## Escalation And Rollback Posture

- If diagnostics, recovery, or compatibility drills fail, treat parser promotion
  readiness as **blocked** until replay confirms root cause and corrective patch.
- If user-impact alarm drills fail critical thresholds, set rollout posture to
  **hold** and require a documented remediation/replay pass before re-enabling.
- If failover controls show non-deterministic behavior, enforce fail-closed
  safe-mode posture and do not advance readiness gates.
- If `rch` reports artifact retrieval failure signatures, treat the run as
  hard-fail and rerun only after remote artifact transport health is restored.

## Operator Verification Checklist

```bash
./scripts/run_parser_operator_developer_runbook.sh ci
cat artifacts/parser_operator_developer_runbook/<timestamp>/run_manifest.json
cat artifacts/parser_operator_developer_runbook/<timestamp>/events.jsonl
cat artifacts/parser_operator_developer_runbook/<timestamp>/commands.txt
cat artifacts/parser_operator_developer_runbook/<timestamp>/step_logs/step_000.log
./scripts/e2e/parser_operator_developer_runbook_replay.sh ci
```
